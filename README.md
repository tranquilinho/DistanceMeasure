DistanceMeasure - an ImageJ plugin for measuring the distance between regions.
Specially useful for tracking the movement of cells.

== Features ==

- LIF file support (experiment series of multichannel stacks)
- export results to Microsoft Excel
- manual refinement of thresholds
- display each channel histogram

== Requirements ==

- ImageJ 1.45 or newer
- Java 1.7 or newer
- loci_tools.jar: BioFormats site (http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads)
- poi.jar: Apache POI (http://poi.apache.org/download.html). Tested with version 3.8.
- forms-1.3.0.jar: JGoodies Forms (http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries)
- file.jar and slider.jar: Java GUI Components (https://github.com/tranquilinho/JavaGuiComponents)

== Installation ==

Download all the required jar files to your ImageJ plugins dir:
- Distance_Measure.jar
- loci_tools.jar: BioFormats site (http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads)
- poi.jar: Apache POI (http://poi.apache.org/download.html). Tested with version 3.8.
- [forms-1.3.0.jar](http://www.jgoodies.com/download/libraries/forms/forms-1_3_0.zip) (unzip and copy the forms-1.3.0.jar inside) 
- file.jar and slider.jar: Java GUI Components (https://github.com/tranquilinho/JavaGuiComponents)

  

== Tutorial ==

The workflow is pretty straighforward: proceed from top to bottom of the window. That is,

1) Import LIF. Select your .LIF file and use this import options:
   - View stack with Hyperstack
   - Color mode: default
   - Autoscale
   
2) Adjust the threshold for each channel (red/green). In the image viewer, you can change channel (C) and slice (Z).


3) Select a region around the cell and "fast add" it to the regions list. If fast add fails, you can use Add. If it takes too long,
you can stop the process and adjust the threshold or the region. You can optionally merge channels.

4) You can export region data as Excel with the "Save Regions" button

About LIF files: they typically have 4 channels and a collection of stacks,
so we may think of it as a 5D image (S Series/experiments x 4 channels x N slices x 2D images)
